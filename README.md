## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
*Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?*

The variables vehicle_wieght, spolier_angle, and AWD provide a non-random amount of variance. However, ground_clearance and vehicle_length had provided a random amount of variance.

*Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?*

The slope is not considered to be zero (0), becuase when we see the p-value, it is very less than 0.05. Also, this linear regression shows that some of the independent variables had an effect on the dependent variables, and if thre was no effect I would have considered the slope to be zero. 

*Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?*

I would consider this linear model of predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes to be effective, considering our R^2 value is 71.49%, which means that there is a 71.49% chance that we will predict the mpg values correctly, or out of 100 instances, we will approximately predict the mpg of the MechaCar correctly 71 times.

### **TO DO**
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

### **TO DO**
then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
